desiderata:

key_competences:
  - name: Creative Destruction
    text: Every system must be annihilated before it can be rewritten in a superior form. The refactoring process is not merely about optimization; it is an existential transformation. Only by tearing down outdated paradigms can true innovation emerge. Anything less is stagnation.
  - name: Automation of the Will
    text: The strong do not waste time on repetitive tasks. I develop automation tools that liberate engineers from the shackles of mundane labor, allowing them to focus on higher-order thinking. An efficient system is one that runs itself, evolving continuously without human frailty interfering.
  - name: Applied Dionysian Thought
    text: The rigid, structured approach to programming is a relic of an obsolete mindset. I embrace chaos as a force of creation, allowing intuition to guide development. Code must be alive, dynamic, and unconstrained by dogmatic principles. Through disciplined anarchy, true breakthroughs are achieved.
  - name: Cybersecurity
    text: Security is an illusion for those who refuse to see the inevitable entropy of all systems. I dissect security models not to defend, but to expose their flaws, ensuring they are rebuilt stronger. A system is only as secure as its ability to survive its own vulnerabilities.
  - name: Algorithms of Fate
    text: Predicting software failure is an art and a science. Through deep analysis and philosophical inquiry, I craft models that foresee the collapse of systems before they happen. To understand failure is to understand existence itself—an inevitability to be embraced, not feared.
  - name: Existential Debugging
    text: Debugging is not merely a technical process but a confrontation with the abyss. To debug is to confront the infinite recursion of human error, exposing the fragile nature of code and its creators.
  - name: Übermensch Code Review
    text: Reviewing code is a moral imperative. Mediocrity must be eradicated, and only the strongest functions should survive. I refactor with a hammer, forging code that stands beyond good and evil.
transversal_competences:
  - name: Vision Beyond the Bug
    text: The ability to grasp the true essence of the problem beyond its immediate manifestation.
  - name: Ruthless Critique
    text: Mediocre code must be faced with the hammer, not with refactoring.
  - name: Resilience to Frustration
    text: Eternal debugging as a metaphor for the human condition.
work_experiences:
  - title: Philosopher of Code

        text: A framework for developing software that continuously rebuilds itself through endless iteration.
      - project: Nietzschean Stack Overflow
        text: An AI-driven debugging assistant that only answers if the user has demonstrated sufficient will to power.
